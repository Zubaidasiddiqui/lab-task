Objective: To demonstrate the use of inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism in Java by modeling a hierarchy of cuddly toys with different roles and behaviors

Overview :The project defines a base class CuddlyToy with properties like size, color, and job. It has two intermediate subclasses: Teddy and Bunny, each extended by two specific toy characters (EngineDriver, Gardner, Clown, and BankManager). Each child class customizes the toy's description and noise through method overriding. The Main class creates and displays all toy objects.

#lab-task:05

Objective: To create a Triangle class in Java using OOP concepts, allowing different ways to construct triangles, calculate perimeter, check for right angles, and count created objects

Overview :The project includes a Triangle class with multiple constructors, validation methods, and a static counter. A Main class demonstrates its use, UML is provided for clear structure.
